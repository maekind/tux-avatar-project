# Tux avatar's project

## Description

This is an open source project created for maintaining a repository to store **Tux** avatars to last in time.

Since I am a linux user (and lover), almost 25 years from my first [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) installation which, by the way, was a Debian 2.2 (Potato), I like to use tux avatars in my *non-standard* accounts. It is so that I have been collecting tux avatars during this years.

Nevertheless, It is a rough task for many reasons, and it takes a lot of work and time.

This repository should be opened to any one who wants to contribute making Tux bigger than ever, to any one who wants to keep and share its avatars in a way to last in time, to any one, like me, considering that this work (tux avatars and derivative art) should be available easily for every one.

Hence, this repository is not coming alone. Because, without some visibility, this work won't be available for every user across the internet. Thus, I have also created a simple website for browsing them effortlessly.

The website, [tux-avatar.com](https://tux-avatar.com), simply shows all the images saved in this repository. As many images we add to the repository, many images we will be able to share with users. Therefore, I encourage you to continue engrossing this repository.

**Together, let's make Tux avatars last in time!**

## How to contribute

First of all, please read the contributing readme [here](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Then, I have done a huge work trying to organize and identify each **Tux avatar**. For sure I have done a lot of mistakes, because I don't know every character in the repository. In this case, I have put a generic name. So, please feel free to create a new issue and rename it.

New images are absolutely well coming, so it is the purpose of the repository. Although, I encourage you to follow some image rules you can find [here](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), for the sake of the quality.

## Automation

When a new image is loaded or deleted or even renaming, and the pull request is merged with the main branch, there is a *github action* raised to generate the file **urls.json** and afterwards upload it to the website hosting. Thus, the website content will always be up to date.

## Donate

Of course, the project generates some costs like:

- Website hosting bill.
- Domain annual price.
- And the last but not least, my own time ðŸ¤“.

But, if we focus on the first 2 recurrent costs and you would like to support this work, you can contribute buying me a ko-fi by clicking on the following button:
